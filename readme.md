Time-Frequency Fast-Fourier-Transformation
========================
Interface Description
-------------------------
The title of the window contains the name of the program, on the right side there are buttons for minimizing, expanding and closing the program. Information about the loaded signal and the selected window **[1]** is displayed on the control panel of the program, which has the following set of tools:

1. Loading the signal function **[2]** â€“ import from the input field **[3]** of the description of the signal function;

2. Adjusting the screen width **[4]** using the slider (number of windows);

3. Selecting the type of window **[5]** (Rectangular, Triangular, Henning. Hamming);

4. Updating window parameters **[6]**, all changes are displayed on the time graph **[7]**;

5. FFT start button **[8]**;

6. Displaying FFT results **[9]**.
